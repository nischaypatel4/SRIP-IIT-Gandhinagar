# Project Overview
In this study, we explored the use of DNA barcoding, specifically the matK gene, to distinguish variants of Bougainvillea, Dianthus, and Plumeria. Our findings provide a more accurate and efficient approach to plant identification and emphasize the value of DNA-based authentication in plant biotechnology.In this study, we explored the use of DNA barcoding, specifically the matK gene, to distinguish variants of Bougainvillea, Dianthus, and Plumeria.
